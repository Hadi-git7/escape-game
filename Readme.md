You were framed of murder and have  been sended to jail ,but you were innocent and no one believed you when you tried to say it isn't you .You would be in jail for 40 years for something you didn't do, so you started thinking to escape this prison .You started to study the area and the guards present in this prison.
    
Then you decided to dig in the ground ,so your first task is to choose the correct tool so you can dig your way out of prison.
<br>

After picking the right tool, you digged a hole in the ground that led you to three ways.One of them will take you outside the prison.
<br>

When you escape the prison,you'll find three destinations. Two of them will bring you back to the jail or lead to your death, and one of them will let you continue the game.
<br>

After picking the correct destination, you will feel so tired and need some rest. You have two choices, one of them will bring you back to jail, so be aware of which one do you choose!

Then you will reach a shelter and check there is no one inside, so you decide to have some rest. Suddenly someone comes in, thus you have to choose what will you do, since one choice will take you back to jail.
